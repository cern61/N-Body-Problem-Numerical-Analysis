# N-Body Simulation

This project implements an **N-body gravitational simulation** using numerical methods and visualizes the motion of celestial bodies over time.

The simulation demonstrates how multiple bodies interact under Newton’s law of universal gravitation and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
